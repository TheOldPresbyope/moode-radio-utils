# BUGS

1. ~~f-format strings require Python >=3.6 but moOde 5.3.1/Raspbian Stretch is stuck at Python 3.5.3.~~
Fixed. Dummied down the print statements to use the old .format().

2. It seems refreshing the Radio Library panel serves only to get the loaded stations into its matrix display. I actually have to reboot the moOde player for the logo to display in the Playback panel or in the thumbnail at the bottom of the Library panel when the station is playing.
