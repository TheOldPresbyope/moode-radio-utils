# BUGS

1. ~~f-format strings require Python >=3.6 but moOde 5.3.1/Raspbian Stretch is stuck at Python 3.5.3.~~
Fixed. Dummied down the print statements to use the old .format().

2. The Grateful Dead pseudo-station logos display in the matrix of stations in the Radio Library panel but when the station is playing, the logo doesn't display in the thumbnail at the bottom of the panel nor does the logo display in the Playback panel. This isn't a problem with the scripts; it's a problem with the pseudo-nature of the station.
